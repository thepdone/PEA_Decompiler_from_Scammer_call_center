I am writing to you today to share the source code of a malicious Android application that I decompiled. The application was created by a group of scammers based in Cambodia who are targeting Thai people.

The scammers created a website, pea.vso-th.cc, that looks like the Google Play Store. They then used the website to trick people into downloading the malicious application.

I am not sure exactly how the application works, but I believe that it is designed to steal personal information from victims.

I would like to thank the YouTube channel Railjacker for making a video about this scam. The video helped me to understand how the application works and to identify the website that the scammers are using.

I have attached the source code of the application to this email. I believe that this code can be used to study the methods used by scammers and to develop better defenses against them.

I would like to emphasize that the source code is provided for educational purposes only. It should not be used to create or distribute malicious applications.

I believe that there are many programmers who are more creative than these scammers. I hope that this code will inspire them to develop new and innovative ways to protect people from online scams.
